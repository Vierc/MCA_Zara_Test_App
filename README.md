# MCA Hiring Test
This is a test project for a recruitment process that simulates a web app to listen to the 100 most popular podcasts according to the Apple list.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux), [react-router-dom](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) and [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) libraries.

## Runs the app in the development mode.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Builds the app for production.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
